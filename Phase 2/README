# Phase 2 — Theoretical Development & Stress Testing
Mars Dust Trap (MDT)

Phase 2 exists to answer a deeper question than Phase 1:

> If MDT works in principle, does the *idea itself* actually hold up under rigorous thinking?

Phase 2 does not build.
Phase 2 does not test.
Phase 2 does not integrate.

Phase 2 is **pure theory**:
structured reasoning, assumption stress-tests, edge-case exploration, and failure analysis.

If Phase 2 cracks under honest thinking, it should die here,
even if Phase 1 loved it.

## Phase 2 Purpose

Phase 2 determines whether MDT remains credible when subjected to:

- disciplined physical reasoning
- stress-testing of core assumptions
- comparison against alternative approaches
- extreme scenario thinking
- failure consequence mapping
- boundary and constraint testing

Phase 2 answers:

> “Even if it works, is MDT still a good idea?”

## Phase 2 Rules

Phase 2 is governed by strict constraints:

### 1️⃣ Theory Only
- No building
- No testing
- No labs
- No field work
- No mission integration

Theory work only.

---

### 2️⃣ TEL-1.0 License Applies
Phase 2 content is governed by the **Theory Exploration License**:
- reading is allowed
- thinking is allowed
- execution requires paid / explicit execution license
- no stealth “use in proposals”

Execution is illegal without license.
Theory is free.

---

### 3️⃣ Brutal Intellectual Honesty
Phase 2 is not sales material.
It must:

- challenge MDT
- question assumptions
- identify where it breaks
- articulate why it might be bad

Phase 2 is where weak ideas get exposed.

---

## What Phase 2 *Is*

Phase 2 includes:

- theoretical performance reasoning
- assumption stress-tests
- extreme case failures
- abuse-case durability thinking
- deployment constraints and tradeoffs
- comparative archetype analysis
- Phase boundary sanity checks

Phase 2 builds confidence **without touching hardware.**

---

## What Phase 2 *Is Not*

Phase 2 is NOT:

- engineering implementation
- qualification planning
- manufacturing planning
- Mars mission design
- operational doctrine writing
- procurement prep
- guarantee phase

If the document sounds like a proposal pitch, it is wrong.

---

## Phase 2 Output Expectation

At the end of Phase 2, we expect:

- a clear articulation of MDT’s theoretical credibility
- identified limits
- identified risk surfaces
- a reasoned conclusion:

> MDT appears theoretically promising **or**
> MDT is theoretically shallow / fragile and not worth deeper pursuit

This phase is about intellectual honesty, not optimism.
