# 00 — Theory Scope
Mars Dust Trap (MDT) — Phase 2

Phase 2 exists to rigorously explore MDT **as a theory**, not as an engineering program or mission deliverable.

This file defines what Phase 2 thinking is allowed to cover,
what it must not drift into,
and the intellectual rules that govern all Phase 2 work.

---

## 1. Phase 2 Core Purpose

Phase 2 answers one central question:

> If MDT works in practice, does it still make sense in theory?

Phase 2 evaluates:
- whether the underlying physics are credible,
- whether assumptions hold under stress,
- whether the system remains valuable under edge conditions,
- whether alternative approaches might dominate MDT’s role,
- and whether the idea collapses under honest scrutiny.

---

## 2. What Phase 2 *Is Allowed* To Do

Phase 2 is explicitly allowed to:

### ✔ Explore Physical Reasoning
- airflow logic
- particle inertia reasoning
- settling versus passthrough conditions
- turbulence implications
- geometry plausibility

---

### ✔ Stress-Test Assumptions
Phase 2 must pressure-test statements like:

- “wind will consistently carry dust through MDT”
- “internal flow behavior continues after getting dirty”
- “abrasion does not destroy usefulness”
- “order-percent reductions are plausible”

If assumptions break, Phase 2 must admit it.

---

### ✔ Explore Boundaries & Edge Cases
Phase 2 may examine:
- extreme winds
- low wind cases
- geometry extremes
- dust load extremes
- degraded / damaged state behavior
- extremely dirty interior states

If MDT is only strong in perfect conditions, that matters.

---

### ✔ Compare Against Other Archetypes
Phase 2 may compare MDT with:
- “do nothing”
- alternative passive mitigators
- terrain shaping
- engineered dust control infrastructure
- procedural / operational mitigations

Comparison does not need to crown a winner.
It must simply be *honest*.

---

### ✔ Identify Risks & Failure Modes
Phase 2 should identify:
- where MDT is weak
- where assumptions are fragile
- where results would disappoint
- where deployment realities might kill value

Weakness discovery is a success condition in Phase 2.

---

## 3. What Phase 2 Is **Not Allowed** To Do

Phase 2 has hard prohibitions:

### ❌ No Engineering Execution
Not allowed:
- detailed manufacturing designs
- structural qualification work
- Mars mission integration documents
- “how to deploy” plans
- procurement framing

If writing starts to sound like a mission concept proposal,
it has already left Phase 2.

---

### ❌ No Testing or Simulation Planning
Phase 2 must NOT drift into:
- lab planning
- simulation development
- test setups
- validation roadmaps

If you are preparing to prove it,
you have left Phase 2 and are pretending Phase 1 never existed.

---

### ❌ No Performance Guarantees
Phase 2 may NOT:
- claim proof
- promise percent outcomes
- declare MDT “solves” anything
- imply guaranteed mission benefit

Phase 2 earns credibility by refusing to pretend.
Not by optimism.

---

### ❌ No Licensing or Sales Framing
Phase 2 is NOT:
- a pitch deck
- a budget argument
- a stakeholder persuasion tool

If rhetoric appears, Phase 2 has failed intellectual discipline.

---

## 4. Truth-Seeking Rules

Phase 2 thinking is governed by three rules:

---

### Rule 1 — Brutal Honesty > Hope
If something looks weak,
call it weak.

If something seems dumb,
say it plainly.

If contradictions appear,
do not “smooth them over.”

---

### Rule 2 — No Outcome Bias
Phase 2 must not be emotionally invested in MDT “working.”

If Phase 2 logically concludes:
> “This isn’t as compelling as we thought,”

that is not failure.
That is Phase 2 doing its job.

---

### Rule 3 — Thinking Must Be Traceable
Reasoning should be:

- explicit,
- readable,
- rationally structured,
- grounded in physics,
- not hand-wavey fantasy.

“We think it’s fine” is not analysis.

---

## 5. Allowed Outputs

At completion, Phase 2 should produce:

- a clear articulation of theoretical feasibility
- identified strengths
- identified weaknesses
- boundary chart of:
  - “where MDT looks good”
  - “where MDT looks questionable”
  - “where MDT likely fails”
- and a simple intellectual verdict:

> MDT is theoretically credible **or**
> MDT is theoretically shallow/flawed

This verdict does NOT authorize execution.
It simply informs whether deeper development is rational.

---

## 6. Relationship to Other Phases

Phase 2 does NOT:
- override Phase 0 constraints
- replace Phase 1 testing
- grant execution rights
- advance TRL
- authorize deployment
- claim validation

Phase 2 is **thinking only**.

Each phase remains legally independent,
per TEL-1.0.

---

## 7. Plain-English Theory Scope Summary

Phase 2 beats on the idea with logic.
If it breaks, it breaks.
If it holds, it earns respect.

No hype.
No heroics.
No fantasy.

Just disciplined thinking.
