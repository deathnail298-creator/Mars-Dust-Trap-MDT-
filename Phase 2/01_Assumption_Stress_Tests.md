# 01 — Assumption Stress Tests
Mars Dust Trap (MDT) — Phase 2

Phase 2 is obligated to challenge MDT’s foundational assumptions.
If assumptions fail under pressure, MDT’s credibility weakens accordingly.

This file identifies the **core assumptions**, stress-tests them, and records where confidence holds and where it cracks.

---

## 1. Core Assumption Set

Phase 0 implicitly relies on several major assumptions:

1️⃣ Wind frequently carries dust in forms MDT can influence  
2️⃣ MDT can meaningfully bias particle paths without power  
3️⃣ Internal behavior persists after MDT becomes very dirty  
4️⃣ Abrasion does not destroy usefulness too quickly  
5️⃣ Small effects, applied continuously, matter over time  
6️⃣ Deployment practicalities do not erase theoretical benefit  

Each is examined independently below.

## 2. Assumption 1 — “Wind frequently carries dust MDT can meaningfully influence”

### What this means
MDT only matters if:
- a non-trivial fraction of dust transport is airborne
- wind drives dust toward operations zones
- particle sizes are within ranges where geometry + turbulence influence behavior

If dust is mostly:
- ground creep,
- saltation-only close to surface,
- or purely electrostatic adhesion…

MDT impact collapses.

### Stress Points
- What if most problematic dust never actually travels at MDT interaction height?
- What if dust transport primarily happens at heights or distances MDT never meaningfully sees?
- What if transport is dominated by fine particles that pass straight through turbulence?

### Honest Evaluation
There *is* Martian airborne dust.  
There is also saltation and ground-hugging behavior.

Confidence: **Moderate**
Risk: **Non-trivial**
Failure Outcome: MDT becomes symbolic rather than functional.

If airborne dust exposure is less dominant than assumed, MDT benefit shrinks correspondingly.

## 3. Assumption 2 — “Passive geometry alone can bias dust behavior”

### What this means
MDT claims:
> turbulence + slowdown + geometry + gravity
can shift a small percentage of dust out of continuing flow.

This assumes:
- turbulent regions actually affect particle trajectories
- residence time increases enough for settlement probability to rise
- downrange dust load reduction is real, not illusion

### Stress Points
- What if turbulence simply entrains dust and spits it out unchanged?
- What if flow acceleration through narrowing regions counteracts settling?
- What if geometry needs to be tuned more precisely than Phase 0 allows?
- What if the cone is simply “decorative fluid drama” with no statistical effect?

### Honest Evaluation
Physics does support turbulence-driven settling *in general*.
Mars conditions change the constants:
- lower density
- different Reynolds regimes
- gravity influences settling differently

Confidence: **Moderate but Sensitive**
Risk: **Dependent on geometry detail**
Failure Outcome: MDT becomes “looks busy, does nothing.”

## 4. Assumption 3 — “Behavior persists when MDT is extremely dirty”

### What this means
MDT expects internal surfaces to:
- accumulate dust,
- self-condition,
- and then stabilize performance rather than collapsing.

### Stress Points
- What if self-conditioning reduces internal volume?
- What if dust cakes into shapes that eliminate meaningful flow changes?
- What if buildup creates internal choking that forces bypass?
- What if wet-equivalent bonding analogs (cement-like dust) form rigid internal blocks?

Worst case:
MDT turns into a clogged useless flag that does nothing.

### Honest Evaluation
This is a **huge wild card**.
Mars dust is abrasive, adhesive, and unpredictable.
Phase 1 will matter greatly here.

Confidence: **Low → Moderate**
Risk: **High**
Failure Outcome:
initial performance exists but collapses into uselessness over time.

---

## 5. Assumption 4 — “Abrasion doesn’t destroy usefulness too quickly”

### What this means
Fabric or flexible cone must:
- survive wind stress,
- survive dust blasting,
- maintain geometry long enough to matter.

### Stress Points
- What if abrasion destroys internal texture in ways that degrade turbulence generation?
- What if tearing reduces structure to rags quickly?
- What if reinforcement required to survive negates simplicity and cost advantage?

This is an engineering survivability reality, but it also has theoretical implications:
- if survivability must be industrial-grade to be useful,
- MDT may lose its “cheap, passive, disposable” advantage.

### Honest Evaluation
Mars abrasion is brutal.
Even robust systems degrade quickly in some contexts.

Confidence: **Moderate**
Risk: **Non-trivial**
Failure Outcome:
Concept remains physically correct, but loses value proposition.

---

## 6. Assumption 5 — “Small reductions add up to meaningful benefit”

### What this means
MDT claims to help via:
- persistent,
- modest,
- statistical reduction,
not heroic intervention.

### Stress Points
- What if dust reduction needs to be far higher to produce any noticeable benefit?
- What if operational environments already drown any small effect in noise?
- What if maintenance burden still dominates regardless?
- What if dust accumulation arises mostly from mechanisms MDT doesn’t affect?

Example uncomfortable question:
If 2% less dust arrives but 98% still does, is this *actually* meaningful?

### Honest Evaluation
This assumption is philosophical and operational, not purely physical.

Confidence: **Unknown / Application-Dependent**
Risk: **Medium**
Failure Outcome:
MDT technically works, but no one cares.

---

## 7. Assumption 6 — “Deployment realities don’t erase theoretical benefit”

### What this means
MDT assumes:
- deployment is trivial enough
- placement feasible
- not intrusive
- doesn’t block operations
- doesn’t complicate logistics
- doesn’t interfere with other infrastructure

If the easiest placement locations don’t intersect dominant dust pathways,
benefit collapses.

### Stress Points
- What if prevailing winds shift too often?
- What if deployment locations are constrained?
- What if meaningful effect requires multiple units but politics costs forbid it?
- What if mission culture resists “non-essential foreground clutter”?

### Honest Evaluation
This assumption lives in mission reality, not physics.
It’s fragile because it depends on human behavior and operations discipline.

Confidence: **Low to Moderate**
Risk: **Very Context Specific**
Failure Outcome:
MDT becomes “one of those things nobody ever bothers with.”

## 8. Consolidated Assumption Risk Map

| Assumption | Confidence | Risk | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|------|-------|
| Airborne dust meaningful | Moderate | Medium | depends on ops environment |
| Passive bias plausible | Moderate | Medium–High | geometry sensitivity matters |
| Works when filthy | Low–Moderate | High | huge uncertainty |
| Survives abrasion | Moderate | Medium | lifetime vs benefit matters |
| Small benefit matters | Unknown | Medium | depends on ops psychology |
| Deployment practicality | Low–Moderate | Medium–High | human factors risk |

---

## 9. Phase 2 Takeaway So Far

MDT theory is **not obviously nonsense**,  
but its validity is **fragile under certain realities**:

- strongly dependent on dust transport type
- sensitive to internal flow behavior persistence
- potentially undermined by abrasion + caking
- potentially strategically irrelevant if benefit too marginal
- potentially logistically sidelined even if valid

None of this kills MDT outright.
But Phase 2 must treat MDT as a **conditional concept**, not a sure thing.

---

## Plain-English Summary

MDT makes sense **if**:
- airborne dust contributes meaningfully,
- passive flow bias works under Mars conditions,
- it keeps working when filthy and damaged,
- survivability is good enough,
- even small improvements matter,
- and missions actually bother to deploy it.

MDT collapses if any two or three of those break simultaneously.

Phase 2 must continue assuming MDT is *plausible*,  
but only under guarded skepticism.
