Phase 3 Governance & Reporting

Governance exists to prevent drift, contain risk, and stop fantasy timelines.

Governance Structure

Accountable Executive: owns success/failure

Program Manager: runs execution reality

Engineering Authority: validates technical basis

Risk Officer: tracks exposure and kills stupidity early

Decision Cadence

Monthly Execution Review

schedule reality

budget reality

risk reality

Quarterly Governance Review

strategic alignment

continuation justification

stop/go/redirect decision

Required Reporting Pack

Every review includes:

Current schedule vs baseline

Spend vs baseline

Problem list (not “lessons learned,” actual problems)

Risk list with probability × impact

Decisions made since last review

Decisions pending that leadership must make

Hard Governance Rules

No “green dashboards” hiding obvious problems

No schedule optimism

No pretending Phase 3 is R&D playtime

If results don’t justify continuation → stop

Phase 3 is not theater. It is disciplined preparation for execution.
