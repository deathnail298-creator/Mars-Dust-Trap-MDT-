Phase 3 Drift

Purpose: Identify how Phase 3 goes wrong when nobody notices it drifting.

Where Phase 3 Drifts in Reality

Re-inventing Phase 1 & 2 instead of executing them

Expanding scope (“while we’re here, what if we also…?”)

Undefined ownership (nobody clearly accountable → slow decay)

Unbounded experimentation masquerading as progress

Paper milestones instead of real milestones

Timeline slippage disguised as “maturity”

Performance claims creep (marketing outruns engineering)

Money burn without decision gates

What Drift Looks Like in Practice

no concrete test article planned

endless meetings, no build commitments

requirements growing rather than converging

new “what if” paths added instead of killed

documentation keeps changing baseline

nobody can answer “when do we stop and build?”

Hard Drift Rule
Phase 3 exists to prepare execution.
If effort isn’t converging toward real hardware and real testing, it is drifting.
