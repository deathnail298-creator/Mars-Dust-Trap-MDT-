Executive Summary — Mars Dust Trap (Windcatcher)

The Mars Dust Trap is not a productivity system.
It is a risk-reduction and environment-conditioning asset.

Its value comes from:

reducing cumulative dust exposure to surface systems

slowing abrasion, fouling, and thermal/optical degradation

reducing maintenance frequency and intervention load

preventing secondary failures driven by dust accumulation

The system saves money by preventing expensive problems, not by “making new capability.”

Executive Comparison Summary
Path	Cost	Time	Risk
Build internally	$700k – $1.6M	9–24 months	High
License Mars Dust Trap	$5k	Immediate	Low (analysis already done)
Executive Interpretation

Licensing replaces ~$700,000 to $1,600,000 in early-phase internal spend with a $5,000 execution gate.

Analysis risk is already front-loaded and resolved.

Execution risk remains appropriately with the licensee.

This preserves capital for:

prototype fabrication

environmental testing

mission integration

operations

Instead of burning budget reinventing feasibility, framing, and justification work that has already been completed.

This is not a technology purchase.
This is a cost-avoidance, schedule-protection, and risk-reduction decision.

Plain-English Summary

Developing an equivalent Mars Dust Trap internally would likely cost $700k–$1.6M and take 9–24 months before producing usable hardware.
Licensing delivers immediate execution permission for $5,000, avoids early-phase reinvention, prevents scope drift, and preserves money for real engineering and testing instead of paperwork and feasibility rediscovery.
