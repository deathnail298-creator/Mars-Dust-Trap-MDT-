# Phase 3 — Validation Pathway

Phase 3 assumes disciplined execution, not blind faith. Validation is expected to occur in an escalating sequence:

1️⃣ Analytical Reasoning
• bounding estimates
• literature-informed assumptions
• conservative expectation setting

2️⃣ Controlled Environment Testing
• wind tunnel testing with martian-representative particulates
• electrostatic charge behavior investigation
• scale model geometry assessment

3️⃣ Analog Environment Trials
• Mars Yard testing
• desert analog sites (Atacama, Mojave, Utah)
• long-duration exposure observation

4️⃣ Operational Integration Testing
• perimeter placement trials
• monitored dust flux comparison
• performance logging

Phase 3 does not require any specific result to be promised; it requires that the pathway to truth is real, disciplined, and measurable.
