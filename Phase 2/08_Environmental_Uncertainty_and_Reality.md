# Environmental Uncertainty & Reality Check

Mars dust transport is not a stable, uniform system. It includes:
• seasonal variability
• region-specific behavior
• electrostatic adhesion effects
• local turbulence structures
• storm-driven anomalies

Phase 2 does NOT assume Mars is predictable.

Instead, it assumes:
• dust exposure will always exist
• probabilities can be biased
• even imperfect interception is beneficial
• passive systems survive uncertainty better than tuned active systems

The Mars Dust Trap is designed as a resilience asset, not a precision instrument. Its value proposition remains valid even under uncertainty: reduce average exposure over operational timeframes.

If future field data proves benefit larger than expected, that is upside. Phase 2 intentionally frames the conservative case.
