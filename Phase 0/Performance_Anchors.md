# Performance Anchors — Mars Dust Trap (MDT)

This file defines the **Phase 0 performance framing** for MDT.

These are not promises.
These are not validated results.
These are conservative **design targets and interpretation rules** that establish what “meaningful but modest” performance means for MDT.

They exist to stop exaggeration, mis-selling, or future scope inflation.

---

## 1. Performance Language Discipline

Phase 0 performance for MDT must always use language consistent with:

- **order-percent improvement**
- **local environmental conditioning**
- **long-duration cumulative benefit**
- **non-critical contribution**
- **no guarantees**

Anyone claiming MDT “solves” dust is already out of bounds.

## 2. Reference Context — What Area Are We Talking About?

All Phase 0 anchors assume a **representative operational area**:

- about **~2,000 m² (~21,500 ft²)**

This number:

- is a **proxy reference**, not a NASA requirement,
- is intentionally conservative,
- provides a clear mental model for “area of concern,”
- prevents people from quietly shifting into base-wide or regional claims.

If real missions operate at smaller footprints, MDT’s relative impact could be more noticeable — but Phase 0 does **not** claim that. We simply anchor conservatively.

---

## 3. Single-Unit Emphasis

All Phase 0 performance framing refers to **a single MDT unit**, placed near the perimeter of an operations area.

- We are NOT talking about fences of devices.
- We are NOT claiming large farm deployments.
- We do NOT treat system-scale multiplication as Phase 0 proof.

One device.
Local effect.
Background benefit.

Multiple units stacking is allowed as a concept — but not used to inflate Phase 0 framing.

## 4. Phase 0 Design Targets (Conservative)

For a single unit operating under normal Mars wind conditions:

- Over **~30–90 days**, MDT targets approximately:

  > **~1% reduction in average incoming windborne dust flux** toward the defined operational area.

- Over **~6–12 months**, MDT targets approximately:

  > **~1.5–2% reduction in average incoming flux**.

- In **favorable geometry, terrain, and wind alignment scenarios**, a plausible non-baseline upper range is:

  > **up to ~3% reduction**.

These numbers represent “order of magnitude design intent,” not measurements.

---

## 5. Interpretation Rules

To prevent misuse, these anchors come with strict interpretation rules:

- These are **rate reductions**, not claims of:
  - total dust removal,
  - cumulative dust inventory clearing,
  - cleaning existing dust buildup.

- Benefits are:
  - **small**
  - **persistent**
  - **cumulative in effect**, not cumulative in the way they are described.

- MDT does **not** claim:
  - linear scaling guarantees,
  - reliability guarantees,
  - life extension guarantees.

This is shaping flow behavior, not rewriting physics.

---

## 6. Graceful Outcomes Only

MDT performance framing is deliberately built so that:

- success = “noticeable but modest benefit”
- failure = “it didn’t help much, and nothing bad happened”

There is no catastrophic downside scenario baked into the performance story.

---

## 7. What “Improvement” Means Here

When MDT performance is referred to in Phase 0, it strictly means:

> “A small but measurable reduction in how much windborne dust reaches a defined local operations area, when averaged over meaningful mission timescales.”

It does **not** mean:
- clean,
- dust-free,
- protected,
- storm-safe,
- or base-immune.

---

## 8. Plain-English Performance Summary

MDT is expected to shave a **few percent** off incoming dust exposure to a work zone over months of operation.  
That’s useful. That’s realistic.  
And that is the full extent of Phase 0 performance framing.
