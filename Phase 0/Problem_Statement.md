# Problem Statement — Mars Dust Trap (MDT)

## 1. The Reality on Mars

Mars surface operations exist inside a permanent, low-grade environmental sandblaster.  
Windborne dust is:

- fine,
- abrasive,
- persistent,
- and always present to some degree.

There is no “normal clear air state.” Dust exposure isn’t an occasional event — it is the background condition of working on Mars.

## 2. What Dust Actually Does

Windborne dust contributes to:

- **mechanical wear**
  - seals, joints, mechanisms, hinges, wheels, interfaces
- **performance degradation**
  - solar arrays, radiators, optics, sensors
- **operational friction**
  - fouled work zones
  - constant cleanup burden
  - reduced visibility and nuisance accumulation over time

None of this is dramatic day-one failure. It’s slow burn degradation. It compounds.  
Over mission timelines, “a little extra dust all the time” turns into non-trivial maintenance cost and operational drag.

## 3. Why Existing Thinking Isn’t Enough

Most dust mitigation focuses on:

- cleaning after the fact,
- designing tougher systems,
- or high-effort solutions for large dust events.

That doesn’t change the baseline truth:

> Dust keeps arriving every day, in small but relentless amounts.

There is a gap between:
- “do nothing”
- and
- “build complex dust mitigation infrastructure”

There isn’t much occupying the space of **cheap, simple environmental conditioning**.

## 4. The Specific Problem MDT Targets

MDT does not try to solve “Mars dust” as a whole.  
It focuses on one narrow, tractable slice:

- **Windborne dust traveling toward a specific operations area**
- that could be **partially intercepted**
- and biased away
- using **passive geometry and gravity**, not complex machinery.

In other words:

> A fraction of the dust heading toward a work zone does not need to arrive there if geometry quietly cheats physics in our favor.

If we can turn “all the dust comes in” into “slightly less dust makes it in,” that matters over long durations.

## 5. What This Problem is *Not*

This repo is **not** addressing:

- regional atmospheric dust behavior
- dust storms as a whole
- plume suppression
- planetary-scale mitigation
- base-wide guaranteed cleanliness

This is a local-zone, incremental-improvement problem.

## 6. Plain-English Problem Summary

Mars environments constantly deliver windborne dust into work areas.  
That dust slowly erodes hardware, fouls surfaces, and piles operational burden over time.

There is currently very little in the “cheap, passive, background mitigation” category.

The problem MDT exists to address is simple:

**Too much dust reaches sensitive operations zones, and nothing cheap and passive is trying to reduce that baseline exposure.**
