# Operating Domain — Mars Dust Trap (MDT)

This file defines the environments, conditions, and deployment contexts where the Mars Dust Trap is intended to operate — and equally important, where it is **not** intended to operate.

---

## 1. Primary Operating Environment

MDT is intended for use **on the surface of Mars**, specifically in and around **localized surface operations zones**, such as:

- areas surrounding habitats,
- work yards and logistics staging zones,
- frequently trafficked work paths,
- rover maintenance or parking areas,
- local “keep reasonably clean-ish” zones around infrastructure.

The design intent is **local environmental conditioning**, not regional modification.

---

## 2. Scale of Relevance

MDT is scoped for **local, human-relevant or rover-relevant footprints**, not landscapes.

Target scale:

- footprint relevance: tens to low hundreds of meters,
- reference zone: ~2,000 m² (~21,500 ft²) proxy operational area,
- performance meaningfully measured in small percent additions or reductions over long timeframes.

If someone is thinking in kilometers or atmosphere-wide behavior, they are already out of MDT’s operating domain.

## 3. Environmental Conditions Assumed

MDT assumes and is constructed around:

- Martian gravity (~0.38g),
- low atmospheric density,
- windborne particulate dust transport,
- intermittent but recurring wind conditions,
- fine, abrasive regolith dust characteristics.

MDT’s logic depends on:

- wind carrying suspended dust,
- gravity assisting fallout/settling,
- passive geometry influencing flow and deposition behavior.

If these fundamentals are absent, MDT is the wrong tool.

---

## 4. Deployment Context Philosophy

MDT belongs in places where:

- dust *will* arrive by default,
- total elimination is impossible or impractical,
- small continuous reductions are still valuable,
- maintenance resources are limited,
- passive reliability is preferred over active systems.

MDT is intentionally suited to **background, low-touch infrastructure** usage. Deploy it, let it run, benefit quietly.

---

## 5. What MDT Is NOT Designed For (Out-of-Domain)

MDT is **not intended** for:

- regional or atmospheric-scale dust control,
- storm defense installations,
- plume interaction zones under active descent engines,
- science-only test sites unrelated to operational habitability,
- environments lacking windborne dust transport dynamics.

It is also **not intended** for use off Mars in Phase 0 framing.  
No Lunar claims. No Titan claims. No Earth cross-application claims. Those are separate problems.

---

## 6. Integration Assumption

MDT is expected to:

- coexist with other dust mitigation approaches,
- supplement, not replace, existing strategies,
- be optional rather than foundational,
- provide incremental benefit, not structural necessity.

It assumes a mission’s survival and performance do not depend on it.

---

## 7. Plain-English Operating Domain Summary

MDT lives on Mars, near real working zones, where wind regularly carries dust toward human or rover activity areas.  
It works at local scales, nudges dust behavior modestly, and lives as quiet, passive environmental conditioning — not heroic infrastructure.
