# Scope & Boundaries — Mars Dust Trap (MDT)

This file defines **what Phase 0 is allowed to cover**, **what it is not allowed to claim**, and **where the conceptual walls are**.

Phase 0 exists to grant **permission to exist**, not permission to build, promise performance, or treat MDT as anything beyond a disciplined early concept.

---

## 1. What Phase 0 *Is*

Phase 0 for MDT strictly covers:

- clear articulation of the problem,
- definition of the concept in concrete, non-fantasy terms,
- conservative performance framing (order-percent),
- explicit non-claims to prevent misuse,
- operating domain definition,
- core philosophy and deployment intent,
- high-level behavior reasoning,
- articulation of value as **background environmental conditioning**.

If someone wants to **understand what MDT is**, Phase 0 provides the authoritative foundation.

---

## 2. What Phase 0 *Is Not*

Phase 0 does **NOT** include:

- detailed materials selection,
- engineering drawings,
- manufacturing assumptions,
- deployment plans,
- integration details,
- cost analysis,
- schedules or timelines,
- TRL advancement statements,
- anything resembling “this is ready to build.”

Phase 0 is not a sales pitch and not a procurement document.

---

## 3. Execution Status

Phase 0 does **NOT** authorize:

- building prototypes,
- running analog tests,
- Mars deployment planning,
- inclusion in formal mission architectures,
- proposal submission using MDT as a component.

Execution belongs to **Phase 1+**, under a separate execution license.

---

## 4. Performance Status

Phase 0 explicitly acknowledges:

- no test data exists here,
- no empirical validation exists here,
- all performance anchors are design intent, not proof,
- all results are speculation-in-good-faith, not demonstrated outcomes.

Anyone presenting Phase 0 as “validated” is already out of bounds.

---

## 5. Risk & Failure Framing

Phase 0 recognizes:

- MDT can be useless in some conditions,
- MDT may not provide measurable benefit in some sites,
- MDT is an optional environmental tool, not a mission-critical element.

Failure of MDT should never equal mission failure.  
Phase 0 does not authorize narratives implying otherwise.

---

## 6. Boundary on Ambition

MDT is intentionally:

- modest,
- local,
- background,
- incremental.

Phase 0 prohibits:

- regional claims,
- storm mitigation fantasy,
- “hero tech” framing,
- tech-messianic narratives.

If someone starts talking about MDT “solving Mars dust,” they have immediately left Phase 0 and are outside this repository’s intent.

---

## 7. Forward Path Acknowledgment (Without Slipping)

It is acceptable in Phase 0 to acknowledge that:

- Phase 1 might involve bounded testing,
- Phase 2 might explore theoretical refinement,
- Phase 3 might discuss value framing.

However:

- Phase 0 does not plan those phases,
- Phase 0 does not pre-sell those phases,
- Phase 0 does not pretend to be those phases.

Phase 0 sits still and does its job.

---

## 8. Plain-English Boundary Summary

Phase 0 defines MDT clearly, conservatively, and honestly.  
It does not hype, it does not promise, it does not authorize execution.  
It simply proves the idea deserves to exist — nothing more and nothing less.
