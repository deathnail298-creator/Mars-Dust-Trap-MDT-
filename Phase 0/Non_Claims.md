# Non-Claims — Mars Dust Trap (MDT)

This file defines what MDT explicitly **does not claim**, **will not promise**, and **must not be represented as**.

These are **hard boundaries**, not marketing positioning.

---

## 1. MDT is NOT a Dust Solution

MDT is **not**:

- a cure for Martian dust,
- a replacement for dust-hardened systems,
- a substitute for routine cleaning and maintenance.

It does not make dust “go away.” It only attempts to reduce how much arrives in a specific place.

---

## 2. MDT is NOT a Storm Mitigation System

MDT is **not** designed for:

- dust storm protection,
- regional dust behavior control,
- atmospheric modification,
- base shielding.

It is not a barrier wall and it is not intended to “protect a base” from severe events.

If a major Martian dust event happens, MDT is allowed to be irrelevant.  
This is not a failure — it was never meant to handle that class of problem.

---

## 3. MDT Does NOT Promise Specific Performance Gains

MDT does **not** claim:

- guaranteed percent reductions,
- guaranteed lifetime improvements of any asset,
- guaranteed operational maintenance savings,
- guaranteed mission reliability improvements.

Phase 0 allows only **order-percent, conservative framing**, and even then only as **design intent**, not proof.

There is no TRL data in Phase 0. No test = no promises.

---

## 4. MDT is NOT a Plume Control or Engineering Substitute

MDT does not:

- manage lander plume dust,
- replace surface prep,
- replace berms, pads, or engineered terrain modifications,
- substitute for point-of-use dust mitigation systems.

It does not compete with engineered dust infrastructure. It is background conditioning.

---

## 5. MDT is NOT a Critical-Path System

MDT must **never** be treated as:

- mission-critical,
- life-critical,
- sole-reliance environmental management.

If MDT fails, the mission should still proceed normally.  
If MDT never existed, the mission should still be viable.

Its value proposition is marginal incremental improvement, not existential dependence.

---

## 6. MDT Does NOT Create New Obligations

MDT does not assert:

- mandatory deployment,
- requirement status,
- architectural dependence.

It is an optional environmental tool. If a mission chooses not to use it, they are not “missing a requirement.” They are simply choosing to absorb dust normally.

---

## 7. MDT Makes NO Claims Beyond Local Effect

MDT does not:

- claim regional influence,
- promise base-wide metrics,
- modify large-scale dust transport.

Its potential effect is **local-zone only**, within its intended deployment context.

---

## 8. Plain-English Non-Claims Summary

MDT isn’t a grand dust solution, storm shield, plume handler, or mission-critical system.  
It does not guarantee performance outcomes or savings.  
It only attempts a modest, local, background reduction in incoming windborne dust, and anything beyond that is outside scope and out of bounds.
