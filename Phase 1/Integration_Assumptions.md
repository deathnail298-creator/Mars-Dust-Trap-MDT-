# Integration Assumptions

To prevent unrealistic deployment expectations, the following are assumed:

• Installed on or near perimeter of operational zones
• Not buried, shielded, or enclosed
• Terrain slope tolerance assumed modest–moderate
• Placement avoids major obstructions when possible
• Thermal cycling expected; materials and geometry account for expansion
• Does not depend on precision alignment
• Degradation expected over time; performance gracefully declines

These are not requirements; they are guardrails preventing fantasy deployment assumptions.
