# Time Windows — Phase 1 (Mars Dust Trap / MDT)

Phase 1 must happen on **realistic, disciplined timeframes**.
Too short = meaningless.
Too long = unfocused science project.

This file defines:
- how long tests should run,
- what we expect to learn in each window,
- and when to stop instead of drifting forever.

---

## 1. Time Philosophy

Phase 1 follows three timing rules:

1️⃣ **No rushing physics.**  
Dust behavior needs time. Early impressions can lie.

2️⃣ **No endless experiments.**  
If testing drags on forever, it means the team isn’t being decisive.

3️⃣ **Each time window must have a purpose.**  
Every test duration must exist to answer a real question.

If a test doesn’t have a defined reason for its length, it is badly designed.

---

## 2. Immediate / Short-Term Window  
*(Hours to a Few Days)*

### Purpose
- Confirm **basic behavior exists at all.**
- Validate physical sanity:
  - wind flows through MDT
  - turbulence behavior appears plausible
  - dust visibly interacts instead of ignoring it

### Expected Outcomes
- Is dust visibly reacting differently near MDT?
- Are there early signs of **settling vs passthrough**?
- Does the structure remain intact under exposure?

### Acceptable Conclusions
- continue to longer testing
- redesign obvious flaws
- kill it if nothing happens at all

Short-term testing is “does Physics even notice this thing exists?”

---

## 3. Medium-Term Window  
*(Weeks)*

### Purpose
- Observe **repeatability** and **stability**.
- Understand whether behavior persists beyond novelty conditions.

### Expected Outcomes
- dust accumulation patterns begin to emerge
- signs of **self-conditioning** (dust lining interior surfaces)
- abrasion effects begin to show
- stability of flow behavior after getting dirty

### Key Questions
- Does MDT **still behave like MDT** after it stops being shiny?
- Does it devolve into useless fabric?
- Does performance stabilize or degrade sharply?

This window matters because Mars reality is “dirty always,” not “clean for 10 minutes.”

---

## 4. Longer-Term Window  
*(1–3 months equivalent exposure)*

### Purpose
Validate whether **persistent environmental conditioning** is plausible.

We are not proving precise percent reductions here.
We are answering a simpler question:

> “After a meaningful duration, does MDT still appear to bias dust behavior in a useful direction?”

### Expected Outcomes
- stable dust deposition zones near MDT
- continued biasing of incoming particulate away from “downrange”
- survivability confidence

If by this point:
- behavior vanished,
- fabric shredded to uselessness,
- or benefit appears trivial,

then MDT probably isn’t worth pursuing.

---

## 5. Total Phase 1 Campaign Duration Expectation

A disciplined Phase 1 campaign should generally:

- complete in **weeks to a few months**, not years
- conclude decisively rather than linger

If Phase 1 needs **years** to show benefit,
then MDT likely isn’t delivering meaningful value.

---

## 6. Continuous vs Intermittent Testing

Phase 1 does **not** require laboratory lifetime simulation.
It can be:

- continuous exposure,
- repeated staged exposures,
- or scheduled observational periods.

The rule:

> Testing cadence must be justified by learning value,
> not convenience or theatrics.

---

## 7. When to Stop

Phase 1 must stop when any of these are true:

- testing confirms **no meaningful behavior**
- survivability appears unacceptable
- results are clear (positive or negative)
- timeline has exceeded planned window without strong justification
- team is only continuing out of sunk-cost emotion

Phase 1 exists to answer a question.  
Once answered, testing ends.

---

## 8. Anti-Zombie Rule

If testing continues **without a clear learning objective**,  
Phase 1 automatically fails timing discipline.

No drifting.
No inertia testing.
No “maybe something interesting happens later.”

If you don’t know what you’re still looking for, stop.

---

## 9. Plain-English Summary

Phase 1 testing should:
- see something quickly,
- prove stability over weeks,
- judge plausibility over months,
- and then stop.

Enough time to learn.
Not enough time to waste life.
