# Kill & Success Criteria — Phase 1 (Mars Dust Trap / MDT)

Phase 1 exists to answer a decision question, not to run experiments forever.

This file defines:
- what counts as **Success**,
- what triggers a **Kill**, and
- what justifies **Pause / Redesign**.

No emotional debate. No political arguments. No sunk-cost heroics.
If the rules say kill it, we kill it.

## 1. Decision Philosophy

There are only three legitimate outcomes:

### ✅ GO (Success)
Evidence strongly suggests MDT provides plausibly meaningful benefit and behaves as expected.

### ⏸ PAUSE / REDESIGN
Physics shows promise, but testing or geometry needs refinement before a real judgment.

### ❌ NO-GO (Kill)
Results show little to no useful benefit, unacceptable survivability, or impractical realities.

There is **no** “let’s keep testing because feelings.”
There is **no** “we invested too much to stop.”
There is **no** “maybe if we ignore results, they’ll change.”

---

## 2. What Counts as Phase 1 Success (GO)

Phase 1 is declared **Successful** if the majority of the following are true:

### ✔ Observable Dust Interception Behavior
- consistent visual / measured evidence that:
  - dust deposits preferentially near MDT,
  - “downrange” dust presence appears measurably reduced,
  - witness plates / sampling surfaces show **directional bias** compared to baseline.

Perfect measurement is not required.
But **clear directional signal** must exist.

---

### ✔ Persistence Beyond “New and Shiny”
- behavior remains after:
  - weeks of exposure,
  - internal surfaces are visibly dusty,
  - early novelty conditions are gone.

If MDT only “works” when fresh and immediately degrades into useless fabric, it fails.

---

### ✔ Survivability Looks Credible
- prototype survives rough handling and abrasive exposure
- no catastrophic tearing with normal expected stress
- performance does not collapse due to damage that should reasonably be expected

If the device is “functionally correct but dies instantly,” that is not success.

---

### ✔ Plausible Order-Percent Impact
- evidence suggests MDT is not just decorative
- observed effects imply a realistic shot at order-percent influence

We do not need precise percent numbers in Phase 1.
We just need credible reason to believe Phase 2 isn’t fantasy.

---

### ✔ Testing Was Honest and Repeatable
- results repeat in multiple sessions or setups
- baseline comparison exists
- data/logs/photos prove this was real testing, not vibes

If testing was sloppy, Phase 1 cannot claim success.

---

## 3. What Triggers a Kill (NO-GO)

Phase 1 must be terminated and MDT declared **NO-GO** if any of the following are true:

---

### ❌ No Meaningful Dust Behavior
If either of the below conditions occur, MDT fails:

- dust flows through with no noticeable change, **or**
- dust accumulates unpredictably with no directional effect

If physics basically ignores MDT, MDT does not deserve existence.

---

### ❌ Behavior Collapses Over Time
Kill it if:

- initial signs vanish after it gets dirty,
- performance decays into uselessness quickly,
- dust buildup destroys effectiveness without practical mitigation.

If MDT only works in fantasy-clean conditions, it isn’t Mars-relevant.

---

### ❌ Structural / Survivability Failure
Kill if:

- tearing / collapse is frequent under reasonable test conditions,
- abrasion renders it functionally useless in realistic time,
- infrastructure cannot survive long enough to matter.

Survivability does not need to be perfect.
But if it’s clearly unrealistic, stop pretending.

---

### ❌ Benefit Appears Trivial
Kill if evidence suggests:

- effect exists,
- but is so tiny it is irrelevant in practice.

This is not an academic exercise.
If real-world benefit is “basically nothing,” MDT is noise.

---

### ❌ Impossible to Test Honestly
Kill if:

- testing complexity becomes absurd,
- data cannot be gathered realistically,
- we cannot create believable analog conditions.

If Phase 1 requires heroic science infrastructure to merely *guess* usefulness,
that alone is a signal that MDT is not a practical tool.

---

## 4. Pause / Redesign Criteria

A **PAUSE / REDESIGN** is justified when:

- behavior exists but is inconsistent,
- prototype design flaws are obvious but fixable,
- mounting or geometry clearly sabotaged results,
- test implementation was clearly flawed.

Examples:

- device visibly too small / badly shaped
- mounting instability corrupted results
- environment selection was poor but fixable

Pause means:
- stop,
- adjust geometry / setup smartly,
- restart testing under clearer, more disciplined conditions.

Pause is NOT:
- a stall tactic,
- a way to avoid calling NO-GO,
- or emotional hesitation.

---

## 5. Documentation Requirements for Any Decision

Regardless of GO, PAUSE, or NO-GO,
Phase 1 must produce:

- short narrative of what happened
- key photos / video
- simple data summary
- statement of decision
- justification tied explicitly to:
  - success criteria
  - kill criteria
  - or pause logic

If you cannot explain the decision in a few pages,
that means Phase 1 was poorly executed.

---

## 6. Final Decision Ownership

A specific authority must be named **before Phase 1 begins** who can say one of:

- “GO — continue”
- “PAUSE — redesign / retry”
- “NO-GO — kill it”

If no one is empowered to kill it,
then Phase 1 has already failed governance discipline.

---

## 7. Plain-English Summary

Phase 1 success means MDT:
- actually affects dust,
- keeps doing so after getting filthy,
- survives realistically,
- and appears capable of meaningful order-percent benefit.

Phase 1 kill means:
- it doesn’t do much,
- it falls apart,
- it only works when new,
- testing proves it’s not worth the trouble.

Phase 1 does not exist to cheerlead MDT.
It exists to decide whether MDT deserves to live.
