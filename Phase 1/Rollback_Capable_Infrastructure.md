# Rollback-Capable Infrastructure — Mars Dust Trap (MDT)

Phase 1 testing must be designed so it can be:
- started easily,
- stopped cleanly,
- abandoned without guilt,
- and rolled back without leaving damage (financial, institutional, or reputational).

If Phase 1 testing creates lock-in, it has already failed its design philosophy.

---

## 1. Core Rule

> **No Phase 1 infrastructure may create dependency.**

If removing the test hardware would meaningfully disrupt operations, then the test was designed incorrectly.

Phase 1 is about truth-finding, not infrastructure building.

---

## 2. Physical Test Infrastructure Requirements

All Phase 1 physical infrastructure must be:

### ✔ Temporary / Removable
- mountings should be removable, not permanent
- devices should be redeployable or disposable
- nothing requires permanent foundations or construction

If you need concrete, welding, or civil engineering, you’ve left Phase 1.

---

### ✔ Minimal Environmental Footprint
- no site scarring
- no permanent terrain change
- no damage to test facilities
- no long-term cleanup burden

Testing should be more like setting up a tripod than building a tower.

---

### ✔ Safe-to-Abandon
If testing stops, the correct procedure should be:

1. turn it off / stop exposing it to wind
2. remove it
3. sweep up any test dust
4. walk away

No lingering hazards.
No ongoing supervision requirement.

---

## 3. Financial Rollback Requirements

Phase 1 must remain financially reversible:

### ✔ Low Cost by Design
Budgets should assume:

- modest prototype costs,
- modest test costs,
- no exotic material dependencies,
- no specialized manufacturing commitment,
- no bespoke rare systems that require protection once paid for.

If a project manager feels obligated to continue “because we already spent money,” Phase 1 violated its rollback rule.

---

### ✔ No Procurement Lock-In
- no large vendor commitments
- no multi-year contracts
- no procurement obligations
- no sunk-cost escalation

If this collapses, finances collapse softly with it.

---

## 4. Organizational Rollback Requirements

Phase 1 must also be politically cheap:

### ✔ No Stakeholder Dependence
No stakeholder should be able to claim:

- program reliance on MDT,
- expectation of delivery,
- integration planning based on Phase 1 results.

MDT should be treated as:

> “Something we tried. If it works, great. If not, fine.”

---

### ✔ No Reputation Gamble
Phase 1 should NOT be framed as:

- bold innovation centerpiece,
- guaranteed savior solution,
- cornerstone of future architecture.

It should be framed as:

> “A disciplined experiment to see if a modest idea is worth pursuing.”

If Phase 1 fails, everyone should feel comfortable simply shrugging.

---

## 5. Data Rollback Requirements

### ✔ Clear Storage
- test data stored independently
- tagged as experimental
- not woven into mission architectures
- easy to freeze, archive, and ignore if killed

### ✔ No Forced Continuity
No data system should require:

- continuous updates,
- ongoing reporting,
- dashboards maintained forever.

When Phase 1 ends, data responsibility ends too.

---

## 6. Kill-Switch Philosophy

Any Phase 1 campaign must include a literal and procedural **kill switch**:

- A clear condition where someone is empowered to say:
  > “This isn’t helping. Shut it down.”
- A predetermined authority to approve shutdown.
- A standing expectation that shutdown is normal, not embarrassing.

Rollback is a feature, not a failure.

---

## 7. Compliance Test

If any of the following are true:
- you’d feel guilty stopping,
- your team would be politically punished for stopping,
- too much money has been spent to stop,
- infrastructure is too embedded to remove easily,

then Phase 1 already failed its design.

Fix the test design, not the truth.

---

## 8. Plain-English Summary

Phase 1 must be easy to walk away from.  
Physically reversible. Financially reversible. Politically reversible.  
If MDT doesn’t work, shutting it down should feel like turning off a lamp — not demolishing a building.
