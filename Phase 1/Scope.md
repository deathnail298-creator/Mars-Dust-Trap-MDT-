# Phase 1 Scope — Mars Dust Trap (MDT)

Phase 1 exists to **test reality**, not to build a product.
This file defines exactly what Phase 1 is allowed to do and what it is forbidden from doing.

---

## 1. Phase 1 Purpose (Single Sentence)

Phase 1 determines whether the Mars Dust Trap concept shows **real-world, observable, plausibly meaningful dust interception behavior** under controlled analog testing — enough to justify further development.

If Phase 1 cannot demonstrate that, MDT dies here. Cleanly.

---

## 2. What Phase 1 *Is Allowed To Do*

Phase 1 is permitted to:

### ✔ Build Simple Prototypes
- crude but structurally honest physical MDT analogs
- low-to-moderate fidelity geometry
- rugged enough to survive testing, not optimized

No perfection required — only honesty and repeatability.

---

### ✔ Conduct Analog Testing
Testing environments may include:

- outdoor terrestrial wind exposure
- controlled wind tunnel or fan setups
- dust chamber environments
- curated Mars analog terrain conditions

The goal:
Observe whether airborne particulate flow
is meaningfully biased downward / redirected
instead of passing straight on.

---

### ✔ Observe Key Behaviors

Phase 1 is explicitly scoped to observe:

- Does dust **actually settle** near MDT instead of traveling onward?
- Does MDT **survive abrasion** long enough to be credible?
- Does a layer of dust **self-condition** internal surfaces?
- Does the device still function after it gets filthy?
- Does behavior remain stable over time?

We are not trying to measure perfection — just honest physics.

---

### ✔ Gather Directional Evidence
Allowed:

- qualitative observation
- simple quantitative sampling
- before/after particulate presence comparisons
- photographic / video evidence
- simple collection trays or witness panels

The standard is:
“Enough signal to tell whether this idea is nonsense or plausible.”

---

## 3. What Phase 1 *Is Not Allowed To Do*

Phase 1 is **not** the place for ambition creep.

The following are strictly out-of-scope:

### ❌ No Mission Integration
- No pretending this is Mars-ready
- No deployment plans
- No operational dependency claims

---

### ❌ No Production Engineering
Not allowed:

- flight qualification planning
- structural certification
- advanced manufacturing engineering
- supply chain optimization
- scaling studies
- mass/power/thermal budgets beyond curiosity

If you’re optimizing, you’re already out of scope.

---

### ❌ No Performance Guarantees
Phase 1 may **not**:

- advertise savings
- claim specific percent reductions
- promise lifecycle extension
- claim validated TRL
- frame results as authoritative

Phase 1 provides **evidence**, not victory speeches.

---

### ❌ No Hero Narratives
Phase 1 may not:

- treat MDT as critical-path infrastructure
- imply guaranteed mission benefit
- frame this as a major breakthrough

Phase 1 is humble and empirical.

---

## 4. Acceptable Outcomes

Phase 1 has only a few legitimate conclusions:

- **GO**
  - Behavior is real
  - Concept shows promise
  - Worth structured continuation

- **PAUSE**
  - Inconclusive
  - Needs refinement or redesign
  - Retry under clearer conditions

- **NO-GO**
  - Does not help enough
  - Not worth time or resources
  - Kill it without guilt

A “we don’t really know” result is unacceptable.
If Phase 1 doesn’t clarify reality, Phase 1 failed.

---

## 5. Boundary Enforcement

If an activity cannot be clearly justified as:

- validating physical behavior,
- understanding survivability,
- or determining plausibility of order-percent impact,

then it is **automatically out of scope**.

No debate.
No hand-waving.
No clever reinterpretation.

---

## 6. Plain-English Scope Summary

Phase 1 is strictly about:
Build something simple.  
Expose it to dust and wind.  
See if it actually does anything useful.  
Decide whether to continue or kill it.

Nothing more.
Nothing less.
