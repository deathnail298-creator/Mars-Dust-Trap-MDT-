# Phase 1 — Mars Dust Trap (MDT)

Phase 1 exists to answer a single question:

> Does MDT deserve to exist in hardware?

Phase 1 is **bounded, disciplined testing** intended to:
- verify basic physical behavior,
- test survivability of simple prototypes,
- validate whether “order-percent reduction” is even plausible,
- and determine if it is worth investing in anything more.

Phase 1 is NOT production.
Phase 1 is NOT mission integration.
Phase 1 is NOT a commitment to Mars use.

This is where MDT either earns its place in the world or dies cleanly and honestly.

## Phase 1 Philosophy

Phase 1 is governed by three rules:

1. **Reality beats opinion.**  
   We stop speculating and start observing.

2. **Cheap, controlled, reversible.**  
   Phase 1 testing must be low-cost, containable, and safe to abandon.

3. **Failure is acceptable; confusion is not.**  
   Phase 1 may conclude “this is useless.”  
   What is NOT acceptable is vague, inconclusive testing that tells us nothing.

## What Phase 1 *Is*

Phase 1 covers:

- basic physical prototypes,
- analog environment testing,
- survivability / abrasion observation,
- dust interception behavior observation,
- data gathering sufficient to decide:
  - “continue,”
  - “pause,”
  - or “kill it.”

Testing at this stage is about **principles and plausibility**, not optimization.

---

## What Phase 1 *Is Not*

Phase 1 is NOT:

- flight hardware development,
- agency qualification,
- full engineering design,
- scaling to farms of units,
- cost optimization work,
- mission integration planning.

Phase 1 does not need to prove perfection.  
It only needs to prove MDT isn’t a bad joke.

## Execution Boundary Reminder

Phase 1 activities still require an execution license.

Reading/testing separation remains:

- Reading & paper analysis → freely allowed
- Building, testing, proposals, funded work → requires execution license

See repository license for details.

## Phase 1 Deliverables

If Phase 1 is conducted properly, it should generate:

- observed behavior characterization
- survivability notes
- abrasion notes
- whether dust meaningfully settles rather than passes through
- basic directional evidence about “order-percent plausibility”
- a clear **Go / No-Go decision**

Not hype. Not slide decks. Reality.

## Plain-English Summary

Phase 1 is where MDT stops being a nice idea on paper and proves whether it actually helps in the real world — even a little.
