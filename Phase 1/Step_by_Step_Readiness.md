# Step-by-Step Readiness — Phase 1 (Mars Dust Trap / MDT)

Phase 1 is not allowed to start just because someone is excited.

This file defines the **minimum conditions** that must be met before any MDT Phase 1 test is authorized.

If these steps are not satisfied, testing is not “early,” it’s **premature**.

---

## 1. Concept Lock Check

**Goal:** Confirm that everyone is testing the *same* MDT concept.

Before Phase 1:

- [ ] Phase 0 documents are complete and stable:
  - Purpose
  - Problem_Statement
  - Non_Claims
  - Operating_Domain
  - Concept_Description
  - Performance_Anchors
  - Scope_Boundaries
- [ ] No open arguments about “what MDT really is.”
- [ ] No competing internal versions of MDT geometry or mission role.

If people are still debating the basic idea, you are not ready to test it.

---

## 2. Test Objectives Defined

**Goal:** Know exactly what you are trying to learn.

Before Phase 1:

- [ ] A written Phase 1 test objective exists, in **plain language**, answering:
  > “What do we want to learn about MDT from this test?”
- [ ] Each planned test has:
  - [ ] a stated primary question (e.g., survivability, interception behavior),
  - [ ] a short list of secondary observations (e.g., self-conditioning, abrasion),
  - [ ] clear criteria for “enough data collected.”

If you cannot write down the question, you are not ready to collect answers.

---

## 3. Prototype Definition Ready

**Goal:** Have a concrete, honest analog to test.

Before Phase 1:

- [ ] A basic prototype design is documented (does not need full drawings):
  - [ ] rough geometry,
  - [ ] size,
  - [ ] mounting method,
  - [ ] materials.
- [ ] Chosen design is **physically buildable** with available resources.
- [ ] Prototype is representative of MDT’s **core behavior**, not a toy that ignores key geometry.

If the prototype has nothing to do with how MDT is supposed to work, the test is noise.

---

## 4. Test Environment Secured

**Goal:** Know where and how you will expose MDT to dust + wind.

Before Phase 1:

- [ ] A test environment has been selected:
  - [ ] outdoor wind exposure,
  - [ ] controlled fan/wind tunnel,
  - [ ] dust chamber,
  - [ ] or other justified analog.
- [ ] Environmental constraints and safety conditions are documented.
- [ ] The environment can:
  - [ ] generate relevant airflow,
  - [ ] expose MDT to dust or surrogate particulate,
  - [ ] be accessed repeatedly for observation.

If the environment cannot simulate “dust in wind,” it is not an MDT test.

---

## 5. Measurement Plan Prepared

**Goal:** Ensure that useful data will actually be captured.

Before Phase 1:

- [ ] Measurement methods are defined, e.g.:
  - [ ] witness plates / sampling surfaces,
  - [ ] before/after dust counts,
  - [ ] photos / video,
  - [ ] simple weight or thickness measurements.
- [ ] A **baseline condition** is defined:
  - [ ] “no MDT” reference behavior,
  - [ ] or an equivalent control configuration.
- [ ] Data recording format is agreed:
  - [ ] logs,
  - [ ] forms,
  - [ ] photo archive structure, etc.

If you’re “just looking at it” with no plan, that’s not Phase 1, that’s sightseeing.

---

## 6. Rollback & Kill Logic in Place

**Goal:** Ensure you can stop cleanly if needed.

Before Phase 1:

- [ ] Rollback-Capable Infrastructure requirements reviewed and satisfied.
- [ ] A clear **kill condition** is documented, e.g.:
  - [ ] “If no observable behavior in X days, stop.”
  - [ ] “If damage exceeds Y, stop.”
  - [ ] “If data is clearly showing no meaningful bias, stop.”
- [ ] A specific person has **authority to call NO-GO** without escalation drama.

If nobody is empowered to say “this isn’t worth it, shut it down,” you’re not ready.

---

## 7. Execution License Check

**Goal:** Ensure legal boundaries are respected.

Before Phase 1:

- [ ] Execution license or contract for MDT Phase 1 work is in place.
- [ ] Scope of allowed activities matches:
  - [ ] prototype building,
  - [ ] test environments,
  - [ ] data collection and internal reporting.
- [ ] No one is relying on “we’ll do it under the radar.”

If there is no execution authorization, Phase 1 is not “early,” it is **unauthorized**.

---

## 8. Decision Framework Defined

**Goal:** Ensure Phase 1 ends with a decision, not ambiguity.

Before Phase 1:

- [ ] GO / PAUSE / NO-GO criteria drafted in advance, tied to:
  - [ ] observed dust behavior,
  - [ ] survivability,
  - [ ] evidence of plausible order-percent benefit,
  - [ ] practical feasibility.
- [ ] A target **decision date** or exposure duration is defined.
- [ ] Stakeholders agree in writing that:
  - [ ] NO-GO is an acceptable outcome,
  - [ ] continuing past Phase 1 requires explicit re-authorization.

If everyone expects “GO” by default, the test is politically rigged.

---

## 9. Readiness Checklist Summary

Phase 1 may only start when:

- the concept is locked,
- objectives are clear,
- prototypes are defined,
- environments are chosen,
- measurement is planned,
- rollback is designed in,
- execution is licensed,
- and decisions are pre-framed.

Anything less is not “lean,” it’s sloppiness.

---

## 10. Plain-English Readiness Summary

Phase 1 starts only after the homework is done:  
everyone agrees what MDT is, what the test is for, where it runs, how we measure it, how we stop it, and how we decide its fate.  
If those basics aren’t in place, the correct action is simple: **don’t start.**
