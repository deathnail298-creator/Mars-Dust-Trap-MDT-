```markdown
# Mars Dust Trap (MDT)
Phase 0 / Phase 1 License v1.0

**Short version:**
- You can read, share, and evaluate this.
- You cannot build, test, deploy, or use it in funded work without a separate written execution license.
- If a `/Theory` section exists later, that content is covered by TEL-1.0.

---

## 1. Definitions

“Work” = all Phase 0 & Phase 1 MDT materials.  
“Author” = original rights holder.  
“You” = any org, company, government, or individual using the Work.  

**Execution** means:
- building or testing hardware based on MDT  
- using MDT in proposals, bids, SBIR/STTR submissions  
- funded internal development  
- integration into any product, service, or mission concept  

**Evaluation** means:
- reading  
- internal discussion  
- paper studies & trade analysis  
- non-funded conceptual exploration  

---

## 2. Rights Granted (Evaluation Only)

You may:
- access, read, and internally distribute for evaluation  
- perform internal concept analysis  

You may **not** remove license references.

---

## 3. Execution Requires Separate License

No execution rights are granted here.

Execution is only legal if:
1) you have a written execution license  
2) it explicitly authorizes your intended use

Without that:
- no prototypes  
- no mission integration  
- no proposal use  
- no funded work  
- no “derivative but clearly based on MDT” execution  

If unsure whether something counts as Execution, assume **it does**.

---

## 4. `/Theory`

If future `/Theory` content exists:
- governed under TEL-1.0  
- execution requires TEL execution license  

---

## 5. No Warranty

“As is.” No safety, suitability, compliance, or mission guarantees.

---

## 6. Liability

Author liability = $1 max where legally enforceable.

---

## 7. Derivatives & Attribution

Internal derivatives allowed for evaluation only.  
Execution still requires license even if modified.

---

## 8. Termination

License auto-terminates if:
- you execute without permission  
- you bring IP conflict claims  

---

## 9. Governing Law

Governed by Author’s chosen jurisdiction unless superseded by an execution contract.

End of License.
