# Purpose — Mars Dust Trap (MDT)

## 1. Core Purpose

The Mars Dust Trap (MDT) exists to provide a **small, passive, always-on reduction** in incoming windborne dust exposure to a local surface operations zone on Mars.

It is intentionally modest:

- not a “dust solution,”
- not storm control,
- not base-wide environmental management.

The purpose is to **reduce the rate at which dust reaches sensitive zones** by a small but meaningful percentage over long timeframes, using simple, rugged, low-maintenance hardware.

## 2. Why this exists

Mars missions live in continuous dust exposure. Windborne dust contributes to:

- abrasion of seals, joints, mechanisms,
- fouling of solar surfaces and optics,
- contamination of work areas and traffic paths,
- incremental maintenance overhead and operational drag.

Most Mars dust discussions focus on big, high-energy fixes. MDT fills the opposite niche:

> A cheap, low-risk background infrastructure tool that quietly makes the environment *slightly less bad* over time.

## 3. What “success” looks like (Phase 0 definition)

Success for MDT is **not** eliminating dust.  
Success means:

- It runs passively with no control burden.
- It biases windborne dust away from key zones.
- Over weeks to months, it produces a **small but measurable** reduction in dust flux into an operations area.
- It degrades gracefully rather than catastrophically.
- Multiple units can be deployed to stack marginal benefit without creating new complexity or risk.

That’s it. Nothing grander. No magical claims.

## 4. Philosophy

MDT is built on three principles:

1. **Simplicity beats cleverness.**  
   The less it does, the harder it is to kill.

2. **Environmental conditioning > direct cleaning.**  
   Instead of constantly cleaning dust after it arrives, MDT tries to slightly reduce how much arrives in the first place.

3. **Graceful failure matters.**  
   If a unit tears, buries, or degrades, nothing catastrophic happens. It just helps less. The system should never become a liability.

## 5. Plain-English Purpose Summary

MDT exists to quietly shave a few percent off incoming windborne dust exposure around a Mars operations area using cheap, passive, durable hardware. It doesn’t solve dust. It simply makes dust slightly less of a problem over long timescales.
